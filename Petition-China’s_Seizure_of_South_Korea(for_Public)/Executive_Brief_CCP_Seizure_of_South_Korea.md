## Urgent Threat Overview

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), through an election fraud and narcotics cartel, has orchestrated a **hybrid seizure of South Korea's institutions**.<br>
The impeachment of pro-U.S. President **Yoon Suk-yeol** on April 4, 2025, using fabricated evidence, marks a **direct challenge to U.S. leadership** in the Indo-Pacific.<br>
